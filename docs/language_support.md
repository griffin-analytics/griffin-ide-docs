# Language Support

Griffin Analytics Studio uses standard technologies for adding language support to custom Griffin Analytics Studio-based products. By integrating the Monaco Code Editor, Griffin Analytics Studio supports the language server protocol (LSP) as well as TextMate.

We recommend you use VS Code Extensions which the Griffin Analytics Studio Framework supports in order to add support for an existing or a custom language. Please refer to the VS Code Language Support documentation for additional details.
