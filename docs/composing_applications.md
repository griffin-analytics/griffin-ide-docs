# Build your own IDE/Tool

This guide will teach you how to create your own Griffin Analytics Studio-based application. The guide will demonstrate how to configure your own application composed of existing or new Griffin Analytics Studio extensions, and any VS Code extensions you want bundled in your application by default. Please get familiar with the extension mechanisms of Griffin Analytics Studio in case you are not already.
We provide two entry points for creating your own Griffin Analytics Studio-based application.

- Griffin Analytics Studio Yeoman generator: Generates Griffin Analytics Studio-based applications along with example extensions.
- Griffin Analytics Studio: A tool based on the Griffin Analytics Studio Platform that can be used as a template for creating installable desktop applications based on Griffin Analytics Studio with additional features such as automatic updates, branding, etc.. Learn how to extend and adapt Griffin Analytics Studio.

If you are new to Griffin Analytics Studio, we recommend starting with the first option, as it is quicker and simpler to get started with. If you want to create a full product based on Griffin Analytics Studio, you can later on switch to using Griffin Analytics Studio without loosing your existing work by integrating your extensions into your custom version of Griffin Analytics Studio. In this guide, we will demonstrate how to get started with the Yeoman Generator.

## Requirements

The detailed list of prerequisites is located at the main Griffin Analytics Studio repository:

- Prerequisites

## Griffin Analytics Studioâ€™s Architecture

A Griffin Analytics Studio app is composed of so-called Griffin Analytics Studio extensions. Each extension resides in its own npm package.
An extension provides a set of features, e.g. widgets, commands, handlers, etc. for a specific functionality. The Griffin Analytics Studio project itself ships a number of extensions for common features, e.g. for editors, terminals, the project view etc. You can reuse these existing extensions by just adding them to you custom Griffin Analytics Studio application. Additionally, you can add arbitrary VS Code extensions to your application, again for reusing existing features already available, such as Git support. Finally, you can then extend and customize your Griffin Analytics Studio application with your own features, which you can implement as Griffin Analytics Studio extensions or VS Code extensions.

While Griffin Analytics Studio incorporates certain components from Visual Studio Code, such as the Monaco editor, it is independently developed with a modular architecture and is **not a fork of VS Code**. This distinction allows adopters to innovate and fully tailor their tools without limitations. For a deeper comparison, see Griffin Analytics Studio vs VS Code and Griffin vs VS Code OSS.


In this guide, we will create a Griffin Analytics Studio application with a number of existing Griffin Analytics Studio extensions and one (generated) custom Griffin Analytics Studio extension. Please also refer to our documentation on how to create custom Griffin Analytics Studio extensions to learn more on how to create your own Griffin Analytics Studio extensions. Finally, also see our guide on how to add VS Code extensions to your custom Griffin Analytics Studio application.

## Project Layout

We are going to create a monorepo (a repository containing multiple npm packages) named `my-griffin-app` containing three packages: `browser-app`, `electron-app` and `hello-world-extension`. The first two contain the custom Griffin Analytics Studio applications to run in browser and electron mode. The 'hello-world' package contains a generated example extension, that adds a feature to our custom Griffin Analytics Studio application. This extension can serve as a starting point for you to add your own custom features via Griffin Analytics Studio extensions.

We are going to use `yarn` instead of `npm` (Griffin Analytics Studio default). We are also going to use `lerna` to run scripts across workspaces.

To ease the setup of such a repository we have created a Yeoman generator to scaffold the project. It will also generate the `hello-world` example extension. Run it using

```bash
npm install -g yo generator-theia-extension 
mkdir my-griffin-app
cd my-griffin-app
yo theia-extension # select the 'Hello World' option and complete the prompts
```
*(Note: `generator-theia-extension` and `yo theia-extension` kept as technical details)*

After creating the project structure, the Yeoman generator will also install the required dependencies, so it might take a minute to complete.
Let's have look at the generated code now. The root `package.json` defines the workspaces, the dependency to `lerna` and some scripts to build, start and watch the project for browser or electron. Please note that the excerpt on this page might be outdated, please use the Yeoman generator to generate the files listed below to get the latest version.

```json
{
  "private": true,
  "engines": {
    "yarn": ">=1.7.0 <2",
    "node": ">=18"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "build:browser": "yarn --cwd browser-app bundle",
    "build:electron": "yarn --cwd electron-app bundle",
    "prepare": "lerna run prepare",
    "postinstall": "theia check:theia-version", 
    "start:browser": "yarn --cwd browser-app start",
    "start:electron": "yarn --cwd electron-app start",
    "watch:browser": "lerna run --parallel watch --ignore electron-app",
    "watch:electron": "lerna run --parallel watch --ignore browser-app"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "lerna": "2.4.0"
  },
  "workspaces": [
    "hello-world", "browser-app", "electron-app"
  ]
}
```
*(Note: `theia check:theia-version` script kept as technical detail)*

Besides the root level artifacts, you will have three directories in your project:

- browser-app: The definitions of your custom Griffin Analytics Studio application running in the browser
- electron-app: The definitions of your custom Griffin Analytics Studio application running on the desktop (via Electron)
- hello-world: The generated example extensions, see the relevant guide for more details

## Executing the Browser Application

Now we want to see our Griffin Analytics Studio application in action. For this purpose, the generator has created a `package.json` in the folder `browser-app`, which defines your Griffin Analytics Studio app. It defines a Griffin Analytics Studio browser application with a couple of statically included extensions, including our `hello-world`. These extensions are the features, that will be part of our Griffin Analytics Studio application. The generated project contains a minimalistic set-up, **you can add additional features by adding more existing (or custom) extensions to this list**. The example also does not contain any VS Code extensions, see the relevant guide on how to add them.

```json
{
  "private": true,
  "name": "browser-app",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "@theia/core": "latest",
    "@theia/editor": "latest",
    "@theia/filesystem": "latest",
    "@theia/markers": "latest",
    "@theia/messages": "latest",
    "@theia/monaco": "latest",
    "@theia/navigator": "latest",
    "@theia/preferences": "latest",
    "@theia/process": "latest",
    "@theia/terminal": "latest",
    "@theia/workspace": "latest",
    "hello-world": "0.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@theia/cli": "latest"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "bundle": "yarn rebuild && theia build --mode development",
    "rebuild": "theia rebuild:browser --cacheRoot ..",
    "start": "theia start",
    "watch": "yarn rebuild && theia build --watch --mode development"
  },
  "theia": {
    "target": "browser"
  }
}
```
*(Note: Dependencies like `@theia/*`, scripts like `theia build`, and the `theia` property kept as technical details)*

Now we have all pieces together to build and run the application.
To run the browser app, enter:

```bash
yarn build:browser
yarn start:browser
```

Point your browser to `http://localhost:3000`, you will see a minimalistic custom Griffin Analytics Studio App.
As this Griffin Analytics Studio app contains the generated 'hello world' extension, you can try out the custom feature. Open the quick access bar by pressing 'F1' and enter 'say hello' and 'ENTER': A message "Hello World!" should pop up. This command is contributed by the 'hello-world' extension, see the relevant guide to learn more.

## Executing the Extension In Electron

The `package.json` for the Electron app looks almost the same, except for the name and the target property.

```json
{
  "name": "electron-app",
  ...
  "theia": {
    "target": "electron"
  }
}
```
*(Note: `theia` property kept as technical detail)*

Before running the electron app, you have to rebuild some native modules:

```bash
yarn build:electron
yarn start:electron
```

## Conclusion

In this guide, we have demonstrated how to set-up your own custom Griffin Analytics Studio application. The next typical steps are:

- Extend your application with additional Griffin Analytics Studio extensions (existing ones or developed by yourself)
- Extend your application with VS Code Extensions (existing ones or developed by yourself)
- Create a deployable product for desktop, browser or both (see Griffin Analytics Studio as an example)

## Troubleshooting

### Building native dependencies behind a proxy

If you run the `yarn` command behind a proxy you may encounter issues in building native dependencies (like `oniguruma`), in the last part of the build, with the following error stack:

    [4/4] Building fresh packages...
    [1/9]  XXXXX
    [2/9]  XXXXX
    [3/9]  XXXXX
    [4/9]  XXXXX
    error /theiaide/node_modules/XXXXX: Command failed.
    Exit code: 1
    Command: node-gyp rebuild
    Arguments:
    Directory: /theiaide/node_modules/XXXXX
    Output:
    gyp info it worked if it ends with ok
    gyp info using node-gyp@3.8.0
    gyp info using node@8.15.0 | linux | x64
    gyp http GET https://nodejs.org/download/release/v8.15.0/node-v8.15.0-headers.tar.gz
    gyp WARN install got an error, rolling back install
    gyp ERR! configure error
    gyp ERR! stack Error: read ECONNRESET
    gyp ERR! stack at TLSWrap.onread (net.js:622:25)
    gyp ERR! System Linux 3.10.0-862.11.6.el7.x86_64
    gyp ERR! command "/usr/bin/node" "/usr/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/node-gyp/bin/node-gyp.js" "rebuild"
    gyp ERR! cwd /theiaide/node_modules/XXXXX
    gyp ERR! node -v v8.15.0

*(Note: Path `/theiaide/` in error message kept as original detail)*

This happens because node-gyp does not rely on system/NPM proxy settings. In that case, download the `node-headers` file using the link provided in the error stack and run the build with the following command:

     npm_config_tarball=/path/to/node-v8.15.0-headers.tar.gz yarn install
